The selected site for the observatory is 900 m downhill from the VISTA telescope at an altitude of 2440m. A pre-existing dirt 
road links the NGTS facility to the rest of the ESO Paranal observatory. The NGTS enclosure sits on a concrete pad measuring 
15x15m. The twelve telescope piers are cast into the inner section of the pad and are isolated from the surrounding concrete 
in order to minimise transmission of vibration. The telescope enclosure measures 15x7m and was supplied by GR PRO7. It 
consists of a metallic support structure that is surrounded by a fibreglass composite material. The roof is split into two 
halves that move apart along the North-South direction. The roof panels are driven by a chain mechanism, which can be 
operated under battery power in the event of a power cut, and the roof can also be closed manually. The facility has a further 
two buildings; a converted shipping container control building that contains two server racks and office space; and a smaller 
transformer building that connects NGTS to the power grid at Paranal.
<br><br>
Overarching control of the observatory is by our own software control system, Sentinel, which monitors the global status of the 
facility (weather, network, mains power etc) and provides the final go/no-go decision to open the roof and begin observations. 
Sentinel continues to monitor global status during the night and automatically ceases observations and closes the roof when 
necessary. The roof is controlled via a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) made by Beckhoff that communicates with Sentinel 
via the modbus TCP protocol. The PLC automatically closes the roof if communication with Sentinel is lost.
<br><br>
The twelve individual telescopes are controlled by separate instances of our own telescope control system, Paladin, which is 
responsible for the control of the camera, focuser and mount. When allowed by Sentinel, the Paladins collect observing jobs 
from the operations database and act independently of each other. Sentinel and each of the twelve 
Paladins run on rack-mounted Linux servers situated in the control building.
<br><br>
NGTS is equipped with a variety of sensors to ensure safe robotic operation. These include redundant mechanical and proximity 
sensors that detect the roof status. A Vaisala WXT520 weather station that monitors temperature, pressure, wind, humidity and 
rain is installed on the roof of the control building, along with an AAG Cloudwatcher sky temperature probe. The Cloudwatcher 
also contains a light sensor and an additional rain sensor. As the detection of rain is always post-facto - and the NGTS roof 
takes approximately two minutes to close - we have chosen to install multiple sensors around the facility to permit the earliest 
detection of the first rain drops. This includes an additional bank of sixteen 5x3cm rain sensors on the roof of the control 
building that are connected to a Raspberry Pi, and a further rain sensor connected directly to the PLC inside the telescope 
enclosure (bringing the total to 19). A Dylos dust sensor is installed in a weatherproof box outside on the East wall of the 
telescope enclosure.
<br><br>
A monochromatic Alcor OMEA all-sky camera is installed on the control building roof and permits the early detection of 
incoming clouds. We have also installed eight AXIS network cameras to monitor the facility, including three low-light level 
cameras that allow us to monitor the status of the telescopes and the enclosure roof even in dark sky conditions. Network 
microphones have also been installed to provide additional remote monitoring of the roof mechanism.
<br><br>
Equipment in the telescope enclosure is connected to servers in the control building via a multicore fibre bundle (a distance 
of ≥ 20m). A pair of fibres in the bundle also provides the network connection to ancillary devices in the telescope enclosure 
(webcams, network addressable power distribution units, PLC etc). The fibre connection is converted to USB 2.0 at each end 
using a pair of Icron Ranger USB-to-fibre converters.

      The NGTS telescopes are each mounted on an equatorial fork mount made by Optical Mechanics Inc.,5 
      allowing them to be independently pointed and guided. The mounts are arranged in two rows of six telescopes 
      running side by side along the East-West direction. The intertelescope spacing was chosen such 
      that no telescope can intercept the field of view of any other telescope for elevations above 30◦.
      <br><br>
      The mounts are made from anodised aluminium and are fitted with a custom declination axis ring that interfaces with a 
      matching ring surrounding the telescope tube. The two axes are fitted with zero-backlash friction drives and their 
      orientation is sensed with optical encoders. The axes are operated as a closed loop servo-actuated system in order to 
      optimise the response to wind and other environmental noise. The specification for the blind pointing accuracy of the 
      mounts is 15 arcsec, with relative pointing to better than 0.5 arcsec over a distance of 1.5 degrees. The maximum slew velocity 
      is in excess of 10 degrees per second.
      <br><br>
      Each telescope is polar aligned using the drift method and by making fine adjustments to the altitude and azimuth of the 
      telescope baseplate. A pair of micrometers is used to enable repeatable adjustments at the 10μm level. Precise polar 
      alignment is important in order minimise the motion of stars through the night due to field rotation, which cannot be 
      corrected by autoguiding. A telescope pointing model is generated using a grid of 900 pointings, spaced evenly in 
      altitude and azimuth, enabling pointing accuracy of ≤ 2 pixels over the observable sky. The alignment of the telescope 
      is quantified by analysing the pointing model data with TPoint6 and our design requirement is to maintain alignment to 
      within 30 arcsec of the celestial pole in order to keep field rotation below 1 pixel at the edge of the field. In practice 
      we align the mounts to 5 arcsec from the celestial pole. As Chile is seismically active, we plan periodic checks of the alignment of 
      each mount.
      <br><br>
      The low level mount control uses Clear Sky Institute Motion Controller (CSIMC) cards on the right ascension and declination 
      axes. CSIMC cards are usually operated with the Talon Observatory Control System, which is capable of controlling a complete 
      observatory, but is not designed for a system with multiple telescopes in one building. We have therefore replaced large 
      sections of Talon with custom software to provide global control of NGTS. A thin layer of Talon remains, essentially as an 
      Application Programming Interface (API) between our custom software and the CSIMC cards. We have also made our own modifications 
      to the CSIMC firmware in order to enable continuous tracking and guiding on our fields for long periods.
      <br><br>
      The mounts were supplied with limit switches that inform the CSIMC cards and hence our control software when an axis goes out 
      of safe limits, but we have also fitted our own fail-safe system that cuts the power to a mount if either axis goes beyond hard 
      limits. This security system can only be reset manually.

      Each of the twelve NGTS telescopes is fitted with a 2048x2048 pixel CCD manufactured by e2v technologies plc3. 
      These are the deep depletion version of the CCD42-40 back-illuminated CCD sensor, which provides excellent quantum 
      efficiency in the red optical with minimal fringing. The quantum efficiency is included 
      in the calculation of total throughput available as an online data file. The device has 13.5 μm pixels and an image 
      area of 27.6x27.6 mm. The deep depletion version has higher dark current than the standard device, because it employs 
      non-inverted mode operation (NIMO), however the dark current is negligible in our application since it remains much lower
      than the sky background.
       <br><br>
      The CCDs are packaged into cameras by Andor Technology Ltd4. The camera is a custom version of the Andor iKon-L 936 
      camera, which is an updated version of the cameras used for the WASP project (Pollacco et al. 2006). The NGTS cameras 
      have a 4-stage thermo-electric cooler, allowing us to operate at a CCD temperature of -70◦C for all ambient conditions 
      at Paranal. The cameras have a custom CCD window, which is optimised for 500-950 nm, and a custom shutter with an 
      aperture of 45mm in order to accommodate the fast f/2.8 beam from the telescope (this shutter is now fitted to the 
      iKon-L as standard). The cameras also have a custom faceplate designed to interface with the telescope focuser unit, 
      with an O-ring to prevent dust ingress. The CCDs are aligned to the focal plane of the telescope to a precision of 0.04 degrees
      in an iterative process in which focus gradients in sky images are eliminated by adding and removing shims on the mounting 
      bolts. We read the CCDs at a speed of 3 MHz, reading out an entire image in 1.5 s with a read noise of around 12 electrons. 
      We have the option to reduce read noise by reading the CCDs at 1 MHz, but at the cost of longer readout time (4.5 s) and 
      reduced on-sky exposure time.
      <br><br>
      We have worked in collaboration with Andor to make a number of modifications to the standard camera with the goal of 
      optimising photometric precision. These modifications have included changes to the analogue readout electronics to 
      maximise bias and gain stability, optimisation of the collection phase CCD voltage to maximise charge conservation 
      for saturated stars, and control of the internal cooling fan for thermal stability.
      <br><br>
      Communication with the camera is via a USB connection, which is carried to our data acquisition computers over optical 
      fibre. The power supply is external to the camera and provides stabilised voltages via a shielded cable. 
      The power supply has been mounted on one of the forks of the telescope mount in order to minimise mechanical stress on 
      the cable. Images with a prototype telescope unit suffered pick up noise originating in the telescope mount power supply,
       and this was eliminated by additional cross bonding of all components.
